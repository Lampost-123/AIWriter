# AI Write architecture

The spec is the source of truth: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a4551334-2c4b-4c42-b4be-4c6726465a79
This file says how the code is laid out so each part can be built without
stepping on the others. Milestone 1 is the first working version.

## Stack

Electron 44, React 19, TypeScript, Vite (electron-vite), Tailwind CSS 4 with
Radix UI primitives, TipTap 3 for the manuscript editor, SQLite through
better-sqlite3 (N-API prebuilds ship in the package, so no native rebuild is
needed for Electron), electron-builder for the Windows installer, electron-updater
for updates, Vitest for logic tests and Playwright (`_electron`) for app tests.

Electron 44 no longer downloads its own binary when installed, and `electron-vite dev` won't
fetch it ("Error: Electron uninstall"), so the `postinstall` script runs `install-electron`.

## Layout

```
src/shared/      Types and the API contract shared by both sides. Only additive changes.
  types.ts       Domain types (World, Story, Chapter, Scene, Entry, Settings, GenerationRecord...)
  api.ts         AppApi: every call the interface can make, plus main->renderer events
  fields.ts      Character / place / lore field lists (forms and context assembly both use them)
  defaults.ts    Default scene card, style guide, settings, creativity presets, countWords
src/main/        Electron main process
  memory/        The memory engine (milestone 2): types.ts is its contract; line.ts (which stories,
                 chapters and scenes come before a point), state.ts (what is true there), scene.ts
                 (reads the database: what counts for one scene). Pure where it can be.
  keeper/        The memory keeper (milestone 2): reads scene text with the memory model and keeps
                 the memory in step with it, plus summaries at every level
  index.ts       Window, lifecycle, flush-on-close
  world.ts       The open world (one folder: world.db, images/, backups/)
  db/            migrations.ts (append-only), repo.ts and other modules holding all SQL (no Electron imports)
  settings.ts    App settings (userData/settings.json) and writing preferences (library folder)
  secrets.ts     API keys, encrypted with safeStorage, kept out of worlds and backups
  ipc/           One handler object per area; ipc/index.ts checks every AppApi method is implemented
  ai/            Providers, context assembly, generation records
  services/      backups.ts, updater.ts
src/preload/     Exposes window.aiwrite (invoke + events). Nothing else.
src/renderer/src/
  lib/           api client, zustand store (navigation + open world), flush registry, editor bridge, theme
  components/ui  The design system. Use these, not raw elements, for buttons, fields, tabs, dialogs, selects
  layout/        Top bar, resizable side panes, inspector, update banner
  features/      binder, editor, inspector, world, style, settings, generate, welcome
```

## Rules

- **Data model.** Change the database only by appending a migration in
  `src/main/db/migrations.ts`. Never edit a shipped migration. All SQL lives in `src/main/db/`.
- **API.** Add methods to `AppApi` in `src/shared/api.ts`, then implement them in
  the matching `src/main/ipc/*.ts` handler object. Errors meant for Adam are thrown as
  `UserError` with a plain-words message and a next step.
- **Keys** never reach the renderer, a world folder, a backup or an export.
- **Look.** Colours come only from the theme tokens in `styles.css` (bg-surface,
  text-muted, border-line, bg-accent, text-ai ...). Amber (`ai`) marks AI suggestions,
  red (`danger`) only must-fix problems, green (`success`) done. Interface text is Inter;
  prose is Literata (`font-serif`). Motion is 150–200 ms and never on text.
- **No jank.** No layout shift while loading (reserve space, render nothing rather than a
  flash), no modals or "are you sure?" for routine actions (make them undoable and show a
  toast), saving is automatic and silent, every AI action streams and can be stopped.
  Deletes are announced with `announceDelete` (`lib/undoDelete.ts`): one Undo toast that
  gathers deletes made while it shows, and Settings › Recently deleted for 30 days after.
- **Words.** On screen, use Adam's words: world, story, chapter, scene, character, place,
  lore, draft. Never "line", "main history", "entity", "generation" or "LLM".
- **Never lose a keystroke.** Anything holding unsaved work registers with
  `registerFlusher` (`lib/flush.ts`); it runs before the window closes and before switching worlds.

## Releases and updates

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes the installer to GitHub Releases of
  Lampost-123/AIWriter when a tag `vX.Y.Z` matching `version` in package.json is pushed.
  CI also builds one on every push (the run's Artifacts) and checks it holds only the app
  (`build/check-package.mjs`).
- Installed copies look for updates there (electron-updater, `publish` in electron-builder.yml)
  **without a token**, so the releases must be readable by anyone: the repository has to be
  public, or the installers published to a separate public releases repository (point `publish`
  at it and give the release workflow a token that can write there; never put a token in
  electron-builder.yml, it would ship inside the app). While the releases can't be read,
  installed copies say "Automatic updates aren't set up yet".
- `AUTO_UPDATES` in src/shared/defaults.ts turns the checks off entirely (Adam then updates by
  hand; Settings › About links to the Releases page). It is on: Adam wants automatic updates.
- In electron-builder.yml each platform's `files` list is complete: a platform list replaces the
  top-level one rather than adding to it.
- The installer isn't code-signed yet, so Windows shows "Windows protected your PC" when it is
  first run; the README says what to click.

## Milestone 2: memory that keeps up

What it adds: mark scene done; summaries at every level; changes over time (baseline plus changes);
relationships and knowledge; plot threads; the memory keeper; context budgeting with short forms;
the Context tab with pins. It also stores everything stories outside one series need (story kinds,
start and end points, start-of-story changes, where entries first exist, Adam's answers), with
the rules in the spec's "Multi-story rules" tab; most of their screens arrive in milestone 3.

**The data model is frozen after this milestone** (migration 2). A later change needs a written
reason here and a new migration, never a rewrite. Until 0.2.0 ships, migration 2 may still change.

### How memory over time works

- An entry row is its **baseline**. Every later fact is a row in `changes`, pinned to an anchor:
  `baseline` (relationships and knowledge Adam sets on the entry page), `story-start` (before a
  story's first scene) or `scene` (it happens in that scene). Kinds: `update` (a note of what is
  now different, plus new field values), `full` (start-of-story full description), `relationship`
  (one per pair of entries, from either side; a later one replaces it), `knowledge` (a character
  learns or forgets a fact; facts are shared by id), `thread` (a plot thread opens or is resolved).
- **The line** (`memory/line.ts`) decides what counts at a point, exactly as the Multi-story rules
  say. Every question about what came earlier goes through `buildLine`: state, the previous scene
  (block 3), story-so-far, the "knows what happened in" sentence, the memory keeper.
- **State** (`memory/state.ts`) applies the baseline, then every change that counts, in line order.
  A full description resets the entry's description, knowledge and relationships (both sides).
  Where a side story and its host change the same thing between the side story's start and end,
  the host wins until Adam answers "Which happened last?" (`answers`, kind `which-last`).
- **Existence:** an entry counts at a scene only if one of its `exists_points` is on the line at or
  before it. Defaults follow the rules (made by hand in the world's first story or outside any story:
  the beginning of the world; in another story: that story's start; found by the memory keeper:
  characters and items at the scene, everything else at the story's start).
- **Places in plain words:** "Book 1, Ch 12, Sc 3" counts live chapters and scenes from 1. Never
  "line", "main history" or "entry" on screen.

### The memory keeper (Adam, 2026-10-02; spec "Source links and automatic upkeep")

The memory updates itself whenever a scene changes, so Adam never has to manage it. There is no
approval step and no Review inbox.

- **Origin.** Every fact records who made it (`Origin` in `shared/types.ts`): `text` (read from a
  scene by the keeper), `adam` (typed or edited by him) or `ai` (drafted by AI). Entries record it
  for the entry and for each field (`entries.origin`, `field_origins_json`); changes, summaries and
  voice lines record it per row. Any hand edit makes the fact (or field) Adam's, and the keeper
  never changes or removes Adam's facts: when the text contradicts one, it raises a consistency
  issue (`issues`) instead. AI-drafted facts are replaced when the text on the same line says
  otherwise. `entries.by_hand` marks an entry Adam ever touched, so it is never moved to Trash
  automatically.
- **Source links** (`source_links`, `db/history.ts`) tie a text fact to the exact words: scene,
  scene version, paragraph id, character range and the quoted words, with a state (`ok`, `changed`,
  `gone`). Every editor paragraph has a stable id. Editing those words updates the fact; a fact goes
  only when its last link is gone or no longer supports it. A text entry whose last mention is gone
  and which Adam never edited moves to Trash for 30 days.
- **History.** Every change to a fact, automatic or by hand, writes a version (`fact_versions`, via
  `recordVersion`) with the run that made it, so any entry can be compared and restored. The SQL
  helpers in `db/repo.ts`, `db/memory.ts` and `db/history.ts` record versions themselves; pass the
  origin and run when the keeper calls them.
- **Runs** (`memory_runs`): after 30 seconds without typing in a scene, on leaving it, on marking it
  done, after a scene version is restored, and at app start for scenes left behind. Runs queue per
  scene and a newer run replaces a queued one. Before a draft is generated, queued or failed runs for
  earlier scenes on the line run first. A run reads only the scene's current draft, finds paragraphs
  added, changed or deleted since the last processed version (by paragraph hash; `scenes.text_version`,
  `memory_version`, `memory_paragraphs_json`), sends them to the memory model with the scene card
  and the linked facts, and applies the model's keep/update/remove/add reply. Runs are idempotent.
  A malformed reply is repaired or retried once; if that fails the scene shows "Memory not updated"
  (`scenes.memory_status = 'failed'`) and is retried on the next trigger and at app start.
- **What changed** (`memory_log`) lists every change grouped by run, newest first: the entry, before
  and after, and the words it came from. Judgement calls apply a default and carry a question mark
  with the alternatives (`question_json`), such as "Which happened last?" and "First seen
  elsewhere". **Undo** restores the previous version and records a suppression (`suppressions`) so
  the same fact isn't added again from the same words unless they change. A quiet "Memory updated"
  note in the top bar opens the list; Adam never has to look at it.
- **Mark scene done** (Ctrl+Enter; stored as `scenes.accepted_at`, named after the spec's earlier
  "Accept") sets the scene's status and refreshes its summary (checks arrive in milestone 5).
  Memory doesn't wait for it.

### Who builds what (parallel build, milestone 2)

| Part | Owns |
|---|---|
| Memory core | `memory/line.ts`, `memory/state.ts`, `memory/scene.ts`, `db/memory.ts` (SQL for changes, exists points, summaries, pins, answers, placement), `ipc/memory.ts`, the test world (`tests/unit/testWorld*`) |
| Memory keeper | `keeper/*`, `db/keeper.ts`, `ipc/keeper.ts`, its tables at the end of migration 2, memory-model prompts, the fake provider's memory replies |
| Briefing | `ai/context.ts`, `ai/gather.ts`, `ai/prompts.ts` (writer), short forms and budgeting, pins and block modes in the briefing |
| Interface | `src/renderer/**`: Mark scene done, Context tab, entry pages for every kind with relationships, knowledge and changes, plot threads on the scene card, summaries, the "What changed" list and the keeper's status |

Shared files (`src/shared/*`, `migrations.ts`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) change only additively; say so in
the commit message.

## Milestone 1 scope

Installer and auto-update; library, worlds and stories; binder; editor with autosave
and backups; providers and model choice; simple forms for characters, places and lore;
style guide; scene cards; context assembly with fixed priorities; Generate draft with
streaming and Stop; "What the AI saw". Anything from a later milestone waits.
