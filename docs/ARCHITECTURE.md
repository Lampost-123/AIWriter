# AI Write architecture

The spec is the source of truth: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a4551334-2c4b-4c42-b4be-4c6726465a79
This file says how the code is laid out so each part can be built without
stepping on the others. Milestone 1 is the first working version.

## Stack

Electron 44, React 19, TypeScript, Vite (electron-vite), Tailwind CSS 4 with
Radix UI primitives, TipTap 3 for the manuscript editor, SQLite through
better-sqlite3 (N-API prebuilds ship in the package, so no native rebuild is
needed for Electron), electron-builder for the Windows installer, electron-updater
for updates, Vitest for logic tests and Playwright (`_electron`) for app tests.

## Layout

```
src/shared/      Types and the API contract shared by both sides. Only additive changes.
  types.ts       Domain types (World, Story, Chapter, Scene, Entry, Settings, GenerationRecord...)
  api.ts         AppApi: every call the interface can make, plus main->renderer events
  fields.ts      Character / place / lore field lists (forms and context assembly both use them)
  defaults.ts    Default scene card, style guide, settings, creativity presets, countWords
src/main/        Electron main process
  index.ts       Window, lifecycle, flush-on-close
  world.ts       The open world (one folder: world.db, images/, backups/)
  db/            migrations.ts (append-only), repo.ts and other modules holding all SQL (no Electron imports)
  settings.ts    App settings (userData/settings.json) and writing preferences (library folder)
  secrets.ts     API keys, encrypted with safeStorage, kept out of worlds and backups
  ipc/           One handler object per area; ipc/index.ts checks every AppApi method is implemented
  ai/            Providers, context assembly, generation records
  services/      backups.ts, updater.ts
src/preload/     Exposes window.aiwrite (invoke + events). Nothing else.
src/renderer/src/
  lib/           api client, zustand store (navigation + open world), flush registry, editor bridge, theme
  components/ui  The design system. Use these, not raw elements, for buttons, fields, tabs, dialogs, selects
  layout/        Top bar, resizable side panes, inspector, update banner
  features/      binder, editor, inspector, world, style, settings, generate, welcome
```

## Rules

- **Data model.** Change the database only by appending a migration in
  `src/main/db/migrations.ts`. Never edit a shipped migration. All SQL lives in `src/main/db/`.
- **API.** Add methods to `AppApi` in `src/shared/api.ts`, then implement them in
  the matching `src/main/ipc/*.ts` handler object. Errors meant for Adam are thrown as
  `UserError` with a plain-words message and a next step.
- **Keys** never reach the renderer, a world folder, a backup or an export.
- **Look.** Colours come only from the theme tokens in `styles.css` (bg-surface,
  text-muted, border-line, bg-accent, text-ai ...). Amber (`ai`) marks AI suggestions,
  red (`danger`) only must-fix problems, green (`success`) done. Interface text is Inter;
  prose is Literata (`font-serif`). Motion is 150–200 ms and never on text.
- **No jank.** No layout shift while loading (reserve space, render nothing rather than a
  flash), no modals or "are you sure?" for routine actions (make them undoable and show a
  toast), saving is automatic and silent, every AI action streams and can be stopped.
- **Words.** On screen, use Adam's words: world, story, chapter, scene, character, place,
  lore, draft. Never "line", "main history", "entity", "generation" or "LLM".
- **Never lose a keystroke.** Anything holding unsaved work registers with
  `registerFlusher` (`lib/flush.ts`); it runs before the window closes and before switching worlds.

## Milestone 1 scope

Installer and auto-update; library, worlds and stories; binder; editor with autosave
and backups; providers and model choice; simple forms for characters, places and lore;
style guide; scene cards; context assembly with fixed priorities; Generate draft with
streaming and Stop; "What the AI saw". Anything from a later milestone waits.
